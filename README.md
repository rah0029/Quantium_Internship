## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and insights generated during my virtual internship, where I worked on understanding customer purchasing behaviors and evaluating store layouts to drive sales. The project involved several key tasks that utilized data analysis techniques to provide actionable recommendations.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Customer Transaction Analysis
**Description:** Conduct analysis on the client's transaction dataset to identify customer purchasing behaviors and generate insights for commercial recommendations.

#### Task Details:
1. **Creating and interpreting high-level summaries of the data**
   - Generated summary statistics to understand overall trends.
   
2. **Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)**
   - Identified outlier transactions that could skew results.
   
3. **Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)**
   - Ensured all data was in the correct format for analysis.
   
4. **Deriving extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data**
   - Enhanced dataset with additional features for deeper insights.
   
5. **Defining metrics of interest**
   - Established metrics to analyze spending patterns across different customer segments.

### Task 2: Benchmark Store Identification
**Description:** Extend analysis from Task 1 to identify benchmark stores that allow testing of trial store layouts on customer sales.

#### Task Details:
1. **Evaluate performance of a store trial performed in stores 77, 86, and 88**
   - Analyzed trial results against control stores.
   
2. **Consider monthly sales experience by total revenue, number of customers, average transactions per customer**
   - Assessed various performance indicators across stores.
   
3. **Create a measure to compare control stores with trial stores using Pearson correlations or magnitude distance**
   - Developed comparative metrics for evaluation.
   
4. **Compare each trial-control pair during the trial period for significant differences in total sales**
   - Conducted statistical tests to determine significance of sales changes.
   
5. **Check if driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customer**
   - Analyzed factors contributing to observed changes in sales.

### Task 3: Data-Driven Recommendation Development
**Description:** Develop a recommendation on whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out across all stores.

#### Task Details:
1. **Analyze performance of trial stores (77, 86, and 88) using selected control stores**
   - Evaluated effectiveness based on comparative analysis.
   
2. **Investigate sales trends, customer behavior, potential drivers of uplift or decline**
   - Explored underlying factors affecting store performance.
   
3. **Provide actionable insights and clear recommendation to category manager**
   - Compiled findings into a comprehensive report with recommendations.

## Conclusion
The analyses conducted during this internship provided valuable insights into consumer behavior and store performance metrics that can guide strategic decisions regarding layout implementations across retail locations.

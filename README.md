# Quantium Virtual Internship

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and insights generated during my virtual internship, where I focused on understanding customer purchasing behaviors and evaluating store layouts to enhance sales. The project involved several key tasks that utilized data analysis techniques to provide actionable recommendations.

### Task 1: Customer Transaction Analysis
Conducted a detailed analysis of the client's transaction dataset to uncover customer purchasing behaviors and generate insights for commercial recommendations.

- Created high-level summaries of transaction data to identify overall trends.
- Detected and addressed outliers in the dataset to ensure accurate results.
- Ensured data integrity by checking formats and correcting discrepancies.
- Derived additional features such as pack size and brand name from existing data.
- Defined key metrics of interest for analyzing spending patterns across different customer segments.

### Task 2: Store Performance Evaluation
Extended analysis from Task 1 to evaluate store performance during trials, assessing the impact of new layouts on sales.

- Analyzed performance metrics of trial stores compared to control stores.
- Considered monthly sales experience through total revenue, number of customers, and average transactions per customer.
- Developed measures using statistical methods (e.g., Pearson correlations) for comparative evaluation.
- Compare each trial-control pair for significant differences in total sales during the trial period.
- Investigated whether changes in sales were due to increased customer numbers or higher purchase frequency.

### Task 3: Data-Driven Recommendation Development
Formulated recommendations based on analyses regarding whether new store layouts should be implemented across all locations.

- Assessed trial store performance against selected control stores through detailed analysis.
- Explored sales trends, customer behavior changes, and potential drivers behind uplift or decline in performance.
- Compiled findings into a comprehensive report with clear recommendations for category managers regarding layout rollouts.

## Conclusion
The analyses conducted during this internship provided valuable insights into consumer behavior and store performance metrics that can guide strategic decisions regarding layout implementations across retail locations.

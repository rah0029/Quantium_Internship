# Quantium Virtual Internship
This repository showcases my work from the Quantium Data Analytics Internship, where I analyzed retail transaction data to provide insights and recommendations for the clientâ€™s Chips category. This project covers three main tasks: Data Preparation, Experimentation with Uplift Testing, and Category Review, leveraging Python and various data science libraries.

## Overview
The objective of this internship was to analyze customer purchasing behaviors and evaluate the impact of store layout changes on sales within the Chips category. This analysis guided targeted recommendations aimed at increasing customer engagement and optimizing sales strategies for our client.

## Task Summaries
### Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
Objective: Understand customer purchasing behaviors and segment customers based on their purchasing tendencies.

-Conducted high-level data cleaning and feature engineering, including identifying outliers and ensuring consistent data formats.
- Derived additional insights, such as product brand and pack size, to enhance the understanding of purchasing drivers.
- Analyzed customer segments to identify purchasing patterns, focusing on high-value segments like young families and retirees.
Result: Provided actionable insights on customer demographics and purchasing trends to guide strategic marketing and promotions.

### Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Objective: Test the impact of a new trial layout in selected stores and measure its effect on customer engagement.

- Selected control stores similar to trial stores in terms of sales patterns and customer demographics using Pearson correlation and distance metrics.
- Compare trial and control stores during the trial period across metrics such as total sales, customer count, and average transactions per customer.
Result: The trial layout positively impacted customer behavior, increasing both customer footfall and sales transactions. The recommended rollout of the new layout across additional stores based on these findings.

### Task 3: Category Review and Recommendations
Objective: Summarize key findings for the Chips category and offer strategic recommendations based on customer behavior and trial outcomes.

- Identified high-value customer segments and peak purchasing times, with an emphasis on holiday season sales.
- Analyzed the effect of affluence on purchasing behavior, highlighting the popularity of larger pack sizes and premium brands among affluent customers.
Result: Suggested seasonal and targeted promotional strategies for affluent demographics and premium products to optimize revenue potential.
